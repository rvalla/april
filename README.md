# april

In *april* [Abril](https://github.com/Abrucita) and me ([Rodrigo](https://github.com/rvalla)) challenge
ourselves in this continuum process which is learning programming. In this case we are looking forward
to write in [C++](https://isocpp.org/). You wont't find here nothing really impressive...
Perhaps, over time, the code in this repository ends full of comments in Spanish. We apologize for that, but we
are from Argentina.  

Feel free to contact Rodrigo by [mail](mailto:rodrigovalla@protonmail.ch) or reach him in
[telegram](https://t.me/rvalla) or [mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@rvalla).
